# ASP.NET Practice Projects

Welcome to the ASP.NET Practice Projects repository! This repository holds a collection of practice projects that I am working on while learning ASP.NET. These projects cover various aspects of ASP.NET, such as routing, controllers, views, models, authentication, and more. Feel free to explore these projects for examples of ASP.NET concepts and techniques. Enjoy and happy coding!
